   * metadata element, and after that element's 28-bit fixed header the next four
   * bits are its declaration count minus one - the low nibble of that last byte.
   * So D0 declares one object, D1 two, through D4 at five, by construction
   * rather than by correlation.
   *
   * The ffmpeg this runs against reports that nibble in the level and leaves the
   * profile naming the codec, which is why nothing else here changes: DTS:X with
   * two objects and DTS:X with five are the same codec, so GetCodecName() above,
   * passthrough routing and every other place that enumerates the DTS-HD MA
   * family by profile go on seeing exactly what they saw before. The level says
   * which variant of a codec, and a later Auro-3D layout can say so in the same
   * field without disturbing this, because the profile is asked first.
   *
   * A stream that declares nothing reports nothing rather than zero, and that is
   * very nearly every DTS:X release in the wild: the older 0x02000850 form has
   * no such nibble, so the level stays at the AV_LEVEL_UNKNOWN it started at and
   * both object labels are left empty. Unlike Atmos, where a bed-only mix
   * genuinely declares zero objects and saying so is an answer, such a stream
   * has said nothing about objects at all.
