 * \brief The listener's own HRTF measurement, if they have chosen one.
 *
 * A head-related transfer function describes how a particular head and pair
 * of ears colour sound arriving from each direction. The engine ships one
 * measured set and can be pointed at another, supplied as a SOFA file.
 *
 * Kodi keeps exactly one such file, copied into the user profile, and treats
 * its presence as the whole of the answer to "is a personal HRTF in use". That
 * has three consequences worth stating, because they are the reason this class
 * exists rather than the setting being handed straight to the engine:
 *
 *  - The engine opens the path with the C library, so it cannot read a Kodi
 *    virtual path. A file chosen from a network share has to be copied before
 *    it can be used at all.
 *  - The copy is checked before it is kept. The engine's reader accepts a
 *    file whose structure it recognises and only warns about the rest, so a
 *    file of the wrong kind can load and render nonsense rather than failing.
 *  - Once staged, the file is local and its path is fixed, so nothing later in
 *    playback depends on a share still being mounted.
