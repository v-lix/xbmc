 * \brief Render Dolby Atmos and DTS:X objects to headphones, out of process.
 *
 * Objects exist only before decode, so this taps where Kodi already frames
 * encoded audio for passthrough: CAEStreamParser reassembles one complete
 * access unit across demux packet boundaries, and those bytes - before any MAT
 * or IEC packing - are exactly what the decoder bridge consumes.
 *
 * The decode and the binaural render happen in a helper process rather than
 * here. CoreELEC runs a 32-bit userspace on a 64-bit kernel, and a shared
 * library takes the word size of whoever loads it; loaded by Kodi that is 32
 * bits, where the same work costs roughly twice as much. Measured on an S922X,
 * decoding Dolby Digital Plus Atmos and rendering its objects costs 0.957 of
 * realtime in 32-bit against 0.419 in 64-bit, and the process boundary itself
 * costs nothing.
 *
 * What comes back is ordinary interleaved stereo float, so ActiveAE and the
 * sink are untouched and nothing downstream can tell this apart from any other
 * decoder.

   * as `sample_pos * 1000000 / sample_rate`. So it is exact, gap-free, and

   * the stream, and the check fired on every film - 2.15 seconds forward at
   * the first frame, swinging back four seconds later. A genuine mid-stream

   * properly, with nothing in flight to confuse it.
