 * 0.42 of a core on Dolby Digital Plus and 0.47 on TrueHD, never above 0.82
 * for more than the odd second, so the work always has somewhere to go. What
 * varies is whether it gets the chance: on Dolby Digital Plus the reserve
 * fills and this limit is what stops it, while on TrueHD it stays near empty
 * because the player only feeds at the speed it plays. Something over a second
 * covers the dips with room to refill afterwards. Larger would not cover more
 * - a renderer that is short on average empties any reserve eventually - and
 * it would put more audio between a seek and what is heard.
 *
 * Do not read the pump thread's own throughput as the render's cost. It sleeps
 * once the bank is full, so it reads about one times realtime whatever the
 * render is doing; that is what made an earlier draft of this comment quote a
 * figure of 0.65 that measured nothing.
 *
 * Feeding stops here rather than rendering: the helper is left with nothing

/*!
 * \brief Level the render is asked for, in dB, before the downmix correction.
 *
 * Before the correction is the whole of the point: this is not the gain the
 * engine receives. WriteConfig subtracts OMNI_NORMALIZED_DOWNMIX_DB from it
 * whenever Kodi is normalising its own stereo fold, which is the default, so
 * -3 here reaches the renderer as -12.5. Reading this number as the render
 * gain overstates it by 9.5 dB and makes the headroom look far worse than it
 * is - which is a mistake worth naming, because it has been made.
 *
 * Chosen to match that fold rather than to satisfy the limiter: what this
 * render has to sound like is Kodi's own downmix of the same film, at the same
 * loudness, so that turning the feature on is not also turning the volume up.
 *
 * The limiter below is the wrong thing to rely on, so the headroom is checked
 * rather than assumed. CAELimiter has no attack: the sample that exceeds full
 * scale is the sample the gain drops on, instantly, and it then holds 25ms and
 * releases over 100. A gain step that abrupt is broadband distortion, worst at
 * the top of the band. So it is meant to catch the rare transient, not to run
 * the level.
 *
 * Six Atmos streams rendered through this configuration at the gain this
 * default actually produces peaked at -5.27, -11.27, -9.04, -7.21, -6.49 and
 * +0.84 dBFS. Only the last goes over at all, on 0.006% of its samples - a
 * demo-disc torture clip, and the rare transient the limiter exists for. On
 * the device the limiter has not been seen to engage at this setting.
 *
 * Turning "maintain original volume" on removes the correction from both this
 * path and the matrix downmix together, so both sit 9.5 dB hotter and both are
 * likelier to reach their limiter. That is what the setting means, and the two
 * paths moving together is the reason to match the fold in the first place.
 *
 * Only the fallback for a settings component that is not there: the number
 * normally comes from the setting, whose default is the same.

 * \brief How much louder the LFE channels are asked to be, in dB.
 *
 * Unity by default, which is what the render has always done: the engine feeds
 * the LFE to both ears without the +10 dB the channel is monitored with in a
 * cinema, matching the untouched routing a speaker layout would give it. The
 * setting exists because that is the one level a listener cannot compensate for
 * anywhere else - there is no LFE speaker on a pair of headphones to turn up,
 * and the level control above moves the whole render together.
 *
 * The ceiling is the +10 dB monitoring convention rather than an arbitrary
 * limit, so the top of the slider restores that relationship rather than
 * exceeding it.
 *
 * Half-decibel steps: the engine carries a bed entry's gain as a float with
 * 0.1 dB resolution, so a fraction survives the whole way to the render gain
 * rather than being rounded off somewhere the listener could not see it happen.
 * Half of a dB is the finer end of what is audible on this one channel, and
