 * for more than the odd second, so the work always has somewhere to go. What
 * varies is whether it gets the chance: on Dolby Digital Plus the reserve
 * fills and this limit is what stops it, while on TrueHD it stays near empty
 * because the player only feeds at the speed it plays. Something over a second
 * covers the dips with room to refill afterwards. Larger would not cover more
 * - a renderer that is short on average empties any reserve eventually - and
 * it would put more audio between a seek and what is heard.
 *
 * Do not read the pump thread's own throughput as the render's cost. It sleeps
 * once the bank is full, so it reads about one times realtime whatever the
 * render is doing; that is what made an earlier draft of this comment quote a
 * figure of 0.65 that measured nothing.

 * \brief How long the helper is given to build the engine and answer OPEN.
 *
 * Separate from the priming timeout above, and much longer, because it bounds

 * and only 48 kHz is free - that is the rate the measured set is stored at, so
 * resampling it is skipped. Every other rate resamples 836 directions and
 * reconstructs each one's minimum phase, four transforms apiece. Measured on a
 * desktop: 215 ms at 48 kHz against 502 at 44.1, 841 at 96 and 1518 at 192; an
 * S922X is about five times slower again, which is the 1.1 s this takes there
 * at 48 kHz and several seconds at anything else.
 *
 * Charged against the priming budget - which is what happened before this
 * existed - the engine spent the whole of it being built, no audio was ever
 * rendered inside it, and every stream that was not 48 kHz fell back to
 * software decoding. Priming is armed after this returns, so what it measures
 * is the renderer keeping up, which is what it is for.
 *
 * Ten seconds is not a target, it is the point at which a helper that has
 * neither answered nor died is assumed hung. A stream pays this once, at open.

 * decides between per-object rendering and the virtual layout can arrive a
 * little after the stream starts. This is how long we keep listening for it.

 * the reserve and a re-prime, and changes the imaging audibly, so it has to

 */
constexpr unsigned int OMNI_MODE_WINDOW_MS = 5000;

/*!
 * \brief Level the render is asked for, in dB, before the downmix correction.
 *
 * Before the correction is the whole of the point: this is not the gain the
 * engine receives. WriteConfig subtracts OMNI_NORMALIZED_DOWNMIX_DB from it
 * whenever Kodi is normalising its own stereo fold, which is the default, so
 * -3 here reaches the renderer as -12.5 for a 5.1 film. Reading this number as
 * the render gain overstates it by 9.5 dB and makes the headroom look far worse
 * than it is - which is a mistake worth naming, because it has been made.
 *
 * Two channel-count terms move it further still, and in the other direction for
 * a narrow source: a stereo album gets neither the downmix match, there being no
 * downmix, nor the summing match a wide layout gets, so the same -3 reaches the
 * renderer as about +1.8. See WriteConfig, where both terms are derived. This
 * default is the number for 5.1, where both terms are zero by construction.
 *
 * Chosen to match that fold rather than to satisfy the limiter: what this
 * render has to sound like is Kodi's own downmix of the same film, at the same
 * loudness, so that turning the feature on is not also turning the volume up.
 *
 * The limiter below is the wrong thing to rely on, so the headroom is checked
 * rather than assumed. CAELimiter has no attack: the sample that exceeds full
 * scale is the sample the gain drops on, instantly, and it then holds 25ms and
 * releases over 100. A gain step that abrupt is broadband distortion, worst at
 * the top of the band. So it is meant to catch the rare transient, not to run
 * the level.
 *
 * Six Atmos streams rendered through this configuration at the gain this
 * default actually produces peaked at -5.27, -11.27, -9.04, -7.21, -6.49 and
 * +0.84 dBFS. Only the last goes over at all, on 0.006% of its samples - a
 * demo-disc torture clip, and the rare transient the limiter exists for. On
 * the device the limiter has not been seen to engage at this setting.
 *
 * Turning "maintain original volume" on removes the correction from both this
 * path and the matrix downmix together, so both sit 9.5 dB hotter and both are
 * likelier to reach their limiter. That is what the setting means, and the two
 * paths moving together is the reason to match the fold in the first place.
 *
 * Only the fallback for a settings component that is not there: the number
 * normally comes from the setting, whose default is the same.

 * \brief How much louder the LFE channels are asked to be, in dB.

 * cinema, matching the untouched routing a speaker layout would give it. The
 * setting exists because that is the one level a listener cannot compensate for
 * anywhere else - there is no LFE speaker on a pair of headphones to turn up,
 * and the level control above moves the whole render together.
 *
 * The ceiling is the +10 dB monitoring convention rather than an arbitrary
 * limit, so the top of the slider restores that relationship rather than
 * exceeding it.
 *
 * Half-decibel steps: the engine carries a bed entry's gain as a float with

 * rather than being rounded off somewhere the listener could not see it happen.

   * What this render has to sound like is Kodi's own stereo fold of the same
   * material, at the same loudness, so that turning the feature on is not also
   * turning the volume up.
   *
   * The first term matches Kodi's downmix normalisation: with "maintain
   * original volume" off the matrix downmix is normalised, a measured 9.5 dB
   * quieter for 5.1 to stereo. None of that reaches here - the flag goes to a
   * resampler this path does not use - so it is applied to the render instead.
   * Matching it is also what keeps the limiter idle: left at full level against
   * a normalised downmix the render would sit 9.5 dB hot and the limiter would
   * be working on almost every film rather than on the rare transient.
   *
   * The second term matches the render's own summing gain, which grows with the
   * source count where a normalised fold does not - but only downwards, for
   * layouts wider than the reference. Below it the term was an extrapolation
   * and listening went against it, so a narrow layout takes the first term
   * alone and lands exactly where 5.1 does.
   *
   * Both are derived in OmniphonyPcmLevelMatch, which is where the rules and
   * their limits are written out and where they are tested. Only the layout is
   * decided here, and only the PCM path has one to offer: the object path's
   * loudness follows the object count, which nothing knows at open and which no
   * channel formula describes, so it keeps exactly the behaviour it has always
   * had - the full normalisation match, no summing term.
   *
   * The layout comes from the decoder rather than from the demuxer's hint. It
   * is still only what is known before anything has been decoded, which is all
   * the engine's config can be written from, but ffmpeg has already reconciled
   * the hint's mask and count by then and defaulted a layout where the mask was
   * missing. Where even that is unknown the match falls back to the reference
   * layout, which is what this path did before either term existed.

     * the same from there, until you notice that nothing has ever come out. The
     * helper now says so itself when it can (see its FEED handler), and this
     * catches whatever it cannot - including an engine that accepts everything
     * and renders nothing.
