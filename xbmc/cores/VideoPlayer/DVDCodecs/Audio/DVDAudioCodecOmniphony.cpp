 * The reserve exists to cover the dips, and the dips are short. Sampling the
 * helper's own CPU once a second across twenty-one TrueHD titles puts the
 * render at 0.67 of a core in the median title and 0.72 at the ninetieth
 * percentile, so on nearly all of them the work has somewhere to go. Two are
 * the exception, sitting at or just past a whole core, and no size of reserve
 * helps those: a renderer with nothing left over has nothing to refill with.
 * Something over a second covers the dips with room to refill afterwards.
 * Larger would not cover more - a renderer that is short on average empties
 * any reserve eventually - and it would put more audio between a seek and what
 * is heard.
 *
 * Wherever there is that surplus, this limit is what stops the reserve
 * growing, on TrueHD as much as on Dolby Digital Plus. Of TrueHD that only
 * became true with the refill in GetData. One packet in per block out merely
 * matches the player's own rate, so it holds the reserve wherever it happens
 * to land instead of filling it - and where it landed on TrueHD was near empty
 * for the length of a film.
 *
 * Do not read the pump thread's own throughput as the render's cost. It sleeps
 * once the bank is full, so it reads about one times realtime whatever the
 * render is doing; that is what made an earlier draft of this comment quote a
 * figure of 0.65 that measured nothing.

/*!
 * \brief Level the render is asked for, in dB, before the downmix correction.
 *
 * Before the correction is the whole of the point: this is not the gain the
 * engine receives. WriteConfig subtracts OMNI_NORMALIZED_DOWNMIX_DB from it
 * whenever Kodi is normalising its own stereo fold, which is the default, so
 * -3 here reaches the renderer as -12.5 for a 5.1 film. Reading this number as
 * the render gain overstates it by 9.5 dB and makes the headroom look far worse
 * than it is - which is a mistake worth naming, because it has been made.
 *
 * Two channel-count terms move it further still, and in the other direction for
 * a narrow source: a stereo album gets neither the downmix match, there being no
 * downmix, nor the summing match a wide layout gets, so the same -3 reaches the
 * renderer as about +1.8. See WriteConfig, where both terms are derived. This
 * default is the number for 5.1, where both terms are zero by construction.
 *
 * Chosen to match that fold rather than to satisfy the limiter: what this
 * render has to sound like is Kodi's own downmix of the same film, at the same
 * loudness, so that turning the feature on is not also turning the volume up.
 *
 * The limiter below is the wrong thing to rely on, so the headroom is checked
 * rather than assumed. CAELimiter has no attack: the sample that exceeds full
 * scale is the sample the gain drops on, instantly, and it then holds 25ms and
 * releases over 100. A gain step that abrupt is broadband distortion, worst at
 * the top of the band. So it is meant to catch the rare transient, not to run
 * the level.
 *
 * Six Atmos streams rendered through this configuration at the gain this
 * default actually produces peaked at -5.27, -11.27, -9.04, -7.21, -6.49 and
 * +0.84 dBFS. Only the last goes over at all, on 0.006% of its samples - a
 * demo-disc torture clip, and the rare transient the limiter exists for. On
 * the device the limiter has not been seen to engage at this setting.
 *
 * Turning "maintain original volume" on removes the correction from both this
 * path and the matrix downmix together, so both sit 9.5 dB hotter and both are
 * likelier to reach their limiter. That is what the setting means, and the two
 * paths moving together is the reason to match the fold in the first place.
 *
 * Only the fallback for a settings component that is not there: the number
 * normally comes from the setting, whose default is the same.

   * One setting, two terms that depend on the channel count, so that -3 dB

   *
   * What this render has to sound like is Kodi's own stereo fold of the same
   * material, at the same loudness, so that turning the feature on is not also
   * turning the volume up.
   *
   * The first term matches Kodi's downmix normalisation: with "maintain
   * original volume" off the matrix downmix is normalised, a measured 9.5 dB
   * quieter for 5.1 to stereo. None of that reaches here - the flag goes to a
   * resampler this path does not use - so it is applied to the render instead.
   * Matching it is also what keeps the limiter idle: left at full level against
   * a normalised downmix the render would sit 9.5 dB hot and the limiter would
   * be working on almost every film rather than on the rare transient.
   *
   * The second term matches the render's own summing gain, which grows with the
   * source count where a normalised fold does not - but only downwards, for
   * layouts wider than the reference. Below it the term was an extrapolation
   * and listening went against it, so a narrow layout takes the first term
   * alone and lands exactly where 5.1 does.
   *
   * Both are derived in OmniphonyPcmLevelMatch, which is where the rules and
   * their limits are written out and where they are tested. Only the layout is
   * decided here, and only the PCM path has one to offer: the object path's
   * loudness follows the object count, which nothing knows at open and which no
   * channel formula describes, so it keeps exactly the behaviour it has always
   * had - the full normalisation match, no summing term.
   *
   * The layout comes from the decoder rather than from the demuxer's hint. It
   * is still only what is known before anything has been decoded, which is all

  /*
   * Hand back nothing once, so the player goes and fetches a packet.
   *
   * CVideoPlayerAudio has one loop and two ways round it. A packet it takes
   * off the message queue is fed here and then drained: ProcessDecoderOutput
   * pushes what comes back into the sink, and while that keeps succeeding the
   * loop sets onlyPrioMsgs, which means priority-only messages and a zero
   * timeout - so it does not come back for another packet at all. It only
   * returns to the queue once ProcessDecoderOutput answers false, which is to
   * say once this codec hands out nothing.
   *
   * For a synchronous decoder that is exactly right: one packet in, one block
   * out, and the false comes after every block. This one answers later than it
   * is asked and holds a reserve, so the same loop drains the whole reserve
   * into a sink that accepts it at the speed it plays, feeding the helper
   * nothing for as long as that takes. It is a sawtooth, and it is in every
   * instrumented playback there is, demos and films alike: the player empties
   * its demux queue into the feed in one burst until AwaitRoom stops it, goes
   * quiet for seconds - four of them, in one film, with the reserve falling
   * from 539ms to 10ms across the gap - and comes back only once the reserve
   * has run out. Nothing about the bank stopped it: a gap runs until the
   * reserve is gone, so the reserve across one is falling towards empty rather
   * than climbing to the OMNI_BANK_MS that would have made AddData refuse a
   * packet. What held the feeding off was never this codec.
   *
   * So the codec has to send it back, and how often decides everything. An
   * empty answer costs the sink nothing - the player fetches a packet, feeds
   * it, and comes straight back for this block - so the ratio of empty answers
   * to served blocks is the ratio of input rate to output rate.
   *
   * One for one only holds the reserve where it is. A TrueHD access unit and a
   * rendered block are both 40 samples, so alternating puts in exactly what
   * goes out: the reserve stops falling, and it can never grow. That is the
   * mistake this had for a while, and AwaitRoom had already named it - matching
   * the two rates "turned out to be the problem: it also stopped the renderer
   * ever getting ahead, because the player only feeds at the speed it plays".
   * Across seventeen instrumented playbacks the reserve reached OMNI_BANK_MS
   * exactly seven times, every one of them the priming overshoot in the first
   * seconds, and from there every playback was flat or falling. A title that
   * primed high stayed clean; one knocked down to 700ms early sat at 700ms for
   * the rest of the film and stuttered, the same file that had been faultless
   * the run before.
   *
   * So while the reserve is short and the helper has room for more, more than
   * one empty answer may follow a block: input then runs ahead of output and
   * the reserve fills. OMNI_REFILL_YIELDS of them puts in twice what goes out.
   * It is self-limiting from both ends. The helper only converts input into
   * reserve as fast as it renders, so the surplus lands in its input queue, and
   * once that is no longer low the allowance drops back to one. At the other
   * end the reserve reaches OMNI_BANK_MS, this stops firing, and AddData's
   * refusal takes over.
   *
   * And once the helper has a real backlog - OMNI_BACKLOG_DIVISOR - it drops
   * to none, and the reserve is spent. One empty answer per block looks like
   * holding the reserve steady, and so it does, but only by tying every block
   * the sink is given to a packet the player must first hand over, and at a
   * helper that is falling behind that packet is the one AwaitRoom makes wait
   * for room. Kodi could then pass audio on no faster than the helper took it
   * in, so a renderer running short had the sink running as short, and the
   * second banked for that sat untouched beside it - whole minutes of a
   * session stuttered that way, every correction landing while the helper's
   * queue sat at the threshold, and most of them with close to a second still
   * banked. Answering with blocks instead keeps the player in its own
   * priority-only loop, taking audio at the pace the sink plays it, and the
   * reserve covers the shortfall for as long as it lasts. Nothing is refused: the player is
   * simply not sent back for a packet the helper has no use for yet, holding
   * as it does hundreds of milliseconds of work already. Its queue drains back
   * below the mark as it renders, feeding resumes one for one, and it settles
   * there - never near enough AwaitRoom's threshold for a feed to wait - until
   * the helper recovers and the queue falls to where refilling starts. What
   * this cannot do is make a renderer faster than it is: a shortfall that
   * outlasts the reserve is still heard, only later by however long the
   * reserve held out against it.
   *
   * The allowance is also what bounds the starvation this had in its first
   * shape. Answering empty on every call - which is what re-arming per feed
   * did - trades a feed for an empty answer with no block in between, and the
   * sink is given nothing at all until the reserve fills. Counting the empty
   * answers since the last block caps that at OMNI_REFILL_YIELDS in a row.
   *
   * And none of it fires when the player has nothing to give. An empty answer
   * only buys anything if the player answers it with a packet; if its demux
   * queue is empty it instead waits on the message queue for as long as the
   * sink has audio left - CVideoPlayerAudio passes GetCacheTime() as the
   * timeout, which AwaitRoom relies on as the player's one throttle - and that
   * is a wait for nothing while this codec sits on a reserve the sink could
   * have had. m_fedSinceYield is the answer to "did the last empty answer bring
   * a packet back": while it does, keep going; when it stops, serve, and let
   * the reserve cover the drought it was banked for. It also keeps the empty
   * answer out of the one path in CVideoPlayerAudio::Process that can mark the
   * stream stalled, which is reached only on a message queue that timed out -
   * that is to say only when nothing was fed. Which holds only if every empty
   * answer clears the flag, the one above for an unrendered bank included:
   * leave one uncounted and the next call reads a feed that arrived before it,
   * and yields on a player that has since gone quiet.
