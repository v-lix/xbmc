 * ordinary CDVDAudioCodecFFmpeg whose PCM is converted to what the renderer's
 * PCM bridge accepts - 48 kHz, interleaved, one label per channel - instead of
 * being handed to the sink.
 *
 * It derives from the ffmpeg codec rather than owning one, for two reasons.
 * The layout accessor below needs the decoder's own AVCodecContext, which is
 * protected; and when the helper dies mid-stream the codec can hand this object
 * straight to its fallback, where it carries on as the plain ffmpeg decoder it
 * already is - no second decoder, and no packet replayed into it.
