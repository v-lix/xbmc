 * \brief The OPCM wire format: how Kodi describes decoded PCM to the renderer.
 *
 * The renderer does not decode. It is fed by a bridge plugin, and the bridge
 * this describes - libpcm_bridge.so - exists because Kodi already decoded the
 * stream and therefore already knows what every channel is. The header says so
 * directly: one label byte per channel, in the order the samples are
 * interleaved.
 *
 * That is the whole reason this is not a WAV header. A WAV header carries a
 * channel count and, at best, a WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE dwChannelMask - and a
 * mask is a lossy round trip in both directions. Its bit order is the
 * interleave order, so the host must re-sort its layout to match; positions
 * with no mask bit cannot be expressed; and one position the renderer does not
 * name (TOP_BACK_CENTER) has nowhere to go at all. Six channels through a plain
 * WAV header are labelled the same whether the source used side or back
 * surrounds, which is audibly wrong and silent about it.
 *
 * \verbatim

 * 0       4     magic "OPCM"
 * 4       2     version, currently 1                    (u16 LE)
 * 6       2     channel count N, 1..=OMNI_PCM_MAX_CHANNELS  (u16 LE)
 * 8       4     sample rate in Hz                       (u32 LE)
 * 12      1     sample encoding, see OmniphonyPcmEncoding
 * 13      1     reserved, must be zero
 * 14      N     one channel label per channel, interleave order
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * No length field follows the header: the stream runs until the bridge is
 * reset, which returns it to awaiting a fresh header. That is also how a format
 * change is announced - reset, then describe the new geometry.
 *
 * These values are the bridge's ABI. They mirror `RChannelLabel` in
 * omniphony-renderer/bridge_api and the parser in pcm_bridge/src/header.rs;
 * neither side may be changed alone.

 * anchoring is the whole reason the summing term could be added at all: it

 *
 * \note The shape of the summing term is theory, not measurement. Incoherent
 * summing predicts 10*log10(N/2) dB relative to stereo, which is what
 * OmniphonyPcmLevelMatch inverts. Plan v2 measured +4.1 dB for six equal noise
 * channels, close to the predicted 4.8 - but only +3.2 dB on a real 5.1 film
 * balance, because a film's surrounds sit well below its fronts and the
 * effective width is smaller than the channel count.
 *
 * That check by ear has since happened, and it went against the extrapolation:
 * below the reference the term is no longer applied at all. What survives is
 * the half that was measured - layouts at and above 5.1, where the ratio is an
 * attenuation rather than a boost. Retuning that half is still this one
 * constant, and moving it moves 5.1, which is the layout every profile in the

 * \brief Derive both corrections from the stream's own layout.
 *
 * This lives beside the wire format rather than in the codec because it is the
 * same knowledge - what the channels of this stream are - and because keeping
 * it free of Kodi's headers is what lets it be tested. Nothing here reaches the
 * renderer; the result is a gain the codec writes into the engine's config.
 *
 * \param mask      the FFmpeg native layout mask, or 0 if only a count is known
 * \param channels  the source channel count; 0 or less means nothing is known,
 *                  and the reference layout's answer is returned so that a
 *                  stream we cannot measure behaves as 5.1 always has
 *
 * \note Whether Kodi's own fold sums anything into the front pair still decides
 * which branch a layout takes, because it is what tells a real fold from a
 * pass-through: a source carrying only front left, front right and the
 * low-frequency channels has nothing to sum, since swresample mixes LFE into
 * the front pair only when a positive lfe_mix_level is set and
 * CActiveAEResampleFFMPEG sets it only when the sublevel it is given is above
 * zero. So stereo, mono and 2.1 are pass-throughs and a centre or a surround
 * makes the fold real. What differs now is the answer rather than the test:
 * a pass-through is given the reference correction outright instead of none,
 * having no width of its own to scale by.
 *
 * \note The 9.5 dB itself is measured for 5.1 only. Narrower folds - quad, 3.0 -
 * normalise by less, so they are corrected by more than they should be. That
 * was true before this function existed and is unchanged by it.
