 * clamps it to full scale on the way into the engine's fixed-point convention,
 * which is the one thing this choice gives up: a source that overshoots 0 dBFS
 * clips there rather than here. Switching to I32Scaled24 moves that decision
 * into Kodi, and is a one-line change precisely because the header says which
 * encoding it is.
